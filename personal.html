            <h2>What i believe in.</h2>
            <p>As someone who was born into the younger generation, there is quite a lot to learn about the internet and the many sub catagories, topics, problems, great innovations it holds. I think that the cyber world we have created definetly isnt great, but has flaws that seem obvious and are in need of change. I think web development is a great place to start. Modern websites are simply annoying to browse, theres an ad on every inch of the screen, accidently clicking one thing can redirect you to a different page, and much much more. Luke smith, who is a youtuber who makes videos mainly on linux, religon, everyday life, etc, created a site called based.cooking. This is a site where people can submit there recipes for dishes they make and have them shared with others. No paywalls, No ads, No trackers, just useful information. I understand that ads are used to pay for servers and whatnot, but for many websites that arent super demanding, and cheaper to run, I see no reason to fill the site with useless junk. I wish to make the internet a great place again. I believe that simple web development can lead to a better, less annoying, and not so frustrating internet.</p>
